# CS3450_Course_Project
Store Management System focusing on checkout ability

In order to install the project for the first time on your local system, 
run the installation.jar program and select the configuration desired.
If the configuration installs successfully, you will be asked whether or
not you want to run the grocery store program. This project requires access
to a mySQL database that has already been set up similarly to the database
that was used for testing.
