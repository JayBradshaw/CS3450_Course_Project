Installation Process:

Execute the file labeled installation.jar
Put in the correct configuration for your database
including hostname and password. Note: if the database
does not have a password you may leave the password field
blank. Choose an installation location by pressing the 
Select Directory button. Press the install button. If
the installation completes successfully, the program will tell
you, then give you the option to run the grocery store program.
If you would simply like to modify the current installation, 
choose the same installation directory and the program will prompt
you as to whether or not you would like to overwrite the current installation.
